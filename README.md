# Overview
I've run into an issue where every other open source budgeting app doesn't scratch the itch for me. I like to budget my money by assigning it to groups and trying to limit myself on spending.

I've also never built an android app before, nor have I used a git repository consistantly.

The primary goals of this paroject are to:

    - Learn how to use flutter
    - Regularly work with github to maintain the project
